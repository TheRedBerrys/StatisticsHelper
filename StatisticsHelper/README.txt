This program was written using Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate. Feel free to open it and look at (and change) the source code if you like.

To run, just run the StatisticsHelper.exe file in the bin/release folder.
This program is a Windows Form Application, so a form will open which you can manipulate.

Some of the logic for this program was cribbed from http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/analysis/zCalc.html
